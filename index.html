          <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">The Strokes are an American rock band from Manhattan, New York. 
            Formed in 1998, the band is composed of singer Julian Casablancas, guitarists Nick Valensi and Albert Hammond Jr., 
            bassist Nikolai Fraiture, and drummer Fabrizio Moretti. They are one of the most prominent bands of the garage rock 
            and post-punk revivals, aiding in the resurgence of indie rock in New York City.
            The band's sound has been described as indie rock, garage rock revival, and post-punk revival by the media. 
            Casablancas has cited Lou Reed of The Velvet Underground as a major influence on his lyrics and singing style. "The way Lou Reed wrote and sang about 
            drugs and sex, about the people around him — it was so matter-of-fact," Casablancas stated in a Rolling Stone interview. "Reed could be romantic in the 
            way he portrayed these crazy situations, but he was also intensely real. It was poetry and journalism." Additionally, he has stated that Bob Marley, 
            Nirvana and Pearl Jam are major influences on his work, the latter being the reason that he started making music after hearing the song "Yellow Ledbetter".</p>

                <p>
                   <b>Nikolai Fraiture</b> was born in New York City to a Franco-Russian mother and French father. 
                   He was raised with his older brother Pierre and younger sister Elizabeth in a working-class family on the Upper East Side.
                   Fraiture met future bandmate Julian Casablancas while attending the Lycée Français de New York at the age of six, 
                   and learned to speak fluent French. Fraiture received his first bass at 16 when his grandfather gave it to him as a 
                   graduation present, but Fraiture gave it away to Casablancas and did not resume playing until two years later. 
                   Fraiture attended Hunter College with The Strokes' lead guitarist Nick Valensi.
