                <p>
                   <b>Nikolai Fraiture</b> was born in New York City to a Franco-Russian mother and French father. 
                   He was raised with his older brother Pierre and younger sister Elizabeth in a working-class family on the Upper East Side.
                   Fraiture met future bandmate Julian Casablancas while attending the Lycée Français de New York at the age of six, 
                   and learned to speak fluent French. Fraiture received his first bass at 16 when his grandfather gave it to him as a 
                   graduation present, but Fraiture gave it away to Casablancas and did not resume playing until two years later. 
                   Fraiture attended Hunter College with The Strokes' lead guitarist Nick Valensi.
